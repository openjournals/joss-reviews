Hello human, I'm @{{bot_name}}, a robot that can help you with some common editorial tasks.

**:warning: JOSS reduced service mode :warning:**

Due to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, JOSS is currently operating in a "reduced service mode". You can read more about what that means in [our blog post](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2020/05/reopening-joss).

For a list of things I can do to help you, just type:

For example, to regenerate the paper pdf after making changes in the paper's md or bib files, type:

```
