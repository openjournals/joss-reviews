## Review checklist for @{{sender}}

**Reminder**: Reviewers may employ AI tools for non-substantive tasks (grammar checking, code contextualization) requiring brief disclosure at review conclusion. All evaluative e.g. determinations—scoring, recommendations, originality assessments, and compliance judgments must reflect human reviewer judgment exclusively. 

### Conflict of interest

- [ ] I confirm that I have read the [JOSS conflict of interest (COI) policy](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/blob/main/COI.md) and that: I have no COIs with reviewing this work or that any perceived COIs have been waived by JOSS for the purpose of this review.

### Code of Conduct

- [ ] **Contribution and authorship:** Has the submitting author ({{author-handle}}) made major contributions to the software? Does the full list of paper authors seem appropriate and complete?
- [ ] **Scope and significance:** Does this submission demonstrate clear research impact or credible scholarly significance as described in the [JOSS guidelines](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html)?
- [ ] **Data sharing:** If the paper contains original data, data are accessible to the reviewers. If the paper contains no original data, please check this item.
- [ ] **Reproducibility:** If the paper contains original results, results are entirely reproducible by reviewers. If the paper contains no original results, please check this item.
- [ ] **Human and animal research:** If the paper contains original data research on humans subjects or animals, does it comply with [JOSS's human participants research policy and/or animal research policy](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/policies.html?highlight=animal#joss-policies)? If the paper contains no such data, please check this item.

### Development history and open-source practice

- [ ] **Development timeline:** Does the project show evidence of sustained development over time (preferably months or years) rather than rapid, recent code generation?
- [ ] **Open development:** Was the software developed openly from early stages? For projects with recent public repositories, is there at least six months of public development history with evidence of releases, public issues/pull requests, and ideally external engagement?
- [ ] **Collaborative effort:** Does the commit history show contributions from multiple developers and evidence of iterative refinement through community feedback?
- [ ] **Good practices:** Does the project look like a reusable, non-throwaway research software project that follows good open-source practices (license, documentation, tests and/or verification processes, releases, and clear contribution/support pathways).

### Functionality

- [ ] **Installation:** Does installation proceed as outlined in the documentation?
- [ ] **Functionality:** Have the functional claims of the software been confirmed?
- [ ] **Performance:** If there are any performance claims of the software, have they been confirmed? (If there are no claims, please check off this item.)

### Documentation

- [ ] **A statement of need**: Do the authors clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve and who the target audience is?
- [ ] **Installation instructions:** Is there a clearly-stated list of dependencies? Ideally these should be handled with an automated package management solution.
- [ ] **Example usage:** Do the authors include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).
- [ ] **Functionality documentation:** Is the core functionality of the software documented to a satisfactory level (e.g., API method documentation)?
- [ ] **Automated tests:** Are there automated tests or manual steps described so that the functionality of the software can be verified?
- [ ] **Community guidelines:** Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing to 1. Contribute to the software 2. Report issues or problems with the software 3. Seek support

### Software paper

- [ ] **Summary (required section):** Has a clear description of the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience been provided?
- [ ] **A statement of need (required section):** Does the paper have a section titled 'Statement of need' that clearly states what problems the software is designed to solve, who the target audience is, and its relation to other work?
- [ ] **State of the field (required section):** Do the authors describe how this software compares to other commonly-used packages? If related tools exist, do they provide a clear "build vs. contribute" justification explaining their unique scholarly contribution and why alternatives are insufficient?
- [ ] **Software Design (required section):** Does the paper include a "Software Design" section that explains the trade-offs weighed, the design/architecture chosen, and why it matters? Is the content compelling and does it demonstrate meaningful design thinking?
- [ ] **Research Impact Statement (required section):** Does the paper include a "Research Impact Statement" section providing evidence of realized impact (publications, external use, integrations) or credible near-term significance (benchmarks, reproducible materials, community-readiness signals)? Is the evidence presented compelling?
- [ ] **AI usage disclosure (required section):** Does the paper include an "AI usage disclosure" section that transparently discloses any use of generative AI in the software creation, documentation, or paper authoring?
- [ ] **Quality of writing:** Is the paper well written (i.e., it does not require editing for structure, language, or writing quality)?
- [ ] **References:** Is the list of references complete, and is everything cited appropriately that should be cited (e.g., papers, datasets, software)? Do references in the text use the proper [citation syntax](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-citations)?
