🚨🚨🚨 **Do not open issues here** 🚨🚨🚨

Issues in this repository are generated by the journal submission system following commands by JOSS editors.

If you have a question about JOSS then please open an issue on the main JOSS repository: https://github.com/openjournals/joss

If you're concerned that your submission has not been received, it almost certainly has,
and an associate editor-in-chief will create the pre-review issue in due course.
Please do *not* open an issue in the main JOSS repository until at least four weeks have passed.
